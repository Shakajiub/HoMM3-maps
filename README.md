## Map descriptions

* All maps have a recommended difficulty setting, e.g. `Balanced for 160%`, but it's totally fine not to follow it. It's mostly there just to inform about the quantity of close-by resources. It should always be either 160% or 200%.

* All maps have a version displayed in the in-game description in the form of `x.y.z`, where the only thing to keep in mind is that when `x` is `0`, the map is not completely finished and is most likely unplayable. `1.0.0` is the first properly balanced and tested version, with `y` incrementing for major bugfixes and `z` for slight errors like typos and decorative object layering. 

* TODO - Individual map descriptions here in the repo.

## Maps without water

In maps without water, all water-related things are disabled, much like HotA does with random maps. This includes:

* **Heroes:** Sylvia, Voy and Elmore replaced with Beatrice, Kinkeria and Derek, respectively. The starting spell of Gem has been changed from Summon Boat to Bless.

* **Artifacts:** Sea Captain's Hat, Necklace of Ocean Guidance and Boots of Levitation disabled.

* **Spells:** Summon Boat, Scuttle Boat and Water Walk globally disabled.

* **Skills:** Navigation globally disabled.
