## Map descriptions

* All maps have a recommended difficulty setting, `Balanced for 160%`, but it's totally fine not to follow it. It's mostly there just to inform about the quantity of close-by resources. It should always be either 160% or 200%.

* All maps have a version displayed in the in-game description in the form of `x.y.z`, where the only thing to keep in mind is that when `x` is `0`, the map is not completely finished and is most likely unplayable. `1.0.0` is the first properly balanced and tested version, with `y` incrementing for major bugfixes and `z` for slight errors like typos and decorative object layering.
