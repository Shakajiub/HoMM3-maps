Message:
Upon further inspection you realize that this little rogue is an old friend of yours. He greets you warmly with an Orcish bow and mutters:		"My chief, I have heard of your quest. My eyes are still as good as ever and can aid you by scouting your enemies in advance of combat. I must also warn you; this land is swarming with pirates and other low-life thieves, who have hidden a lot of the resources in inconspicuous caches scattered around the area. This sack of gold behind me is but an example. Allow me to join you, and I'll do my best as an advisor to the great warchief once again."

Message:
You step inside the hut only to find the rotting corpse of a witch. Taking a look around the place you are suddenly startled by the corpse raising it's head and start speaking:		"You seek the {Cloak of the Undead King}. I feel it. I understand it. The immense power of such a wonderful artifact would guarantee your victory over the LIVING. Ages ago it was disenchanted into multiple pieces and scattered around the world. I can assemble one of the pieces for you if you return to me its two essences, the Amulets of Life and Death. Return back to me if you need more help and I will tell you what I can."
You re-enter the hut to find the witch again, but this time she looks much healthier, younger, and actually... living.		"Ah, the {Cloak of the Undead King}. Have you seen the ancient Learning Stone just behind my hut? There are two more just like it quite near to your kingdom. One on an infernal island to the West, and the other in the roughlands to the North-East. Seek them out to discover the Pendants, but beware, they were sealed away for a reason; there are people who do not want them found again."
As you approach the hut, a skeleton emerges from inside to lead you to the Learning Stone outside. There you meet the witch again, about to start some sort of a ritual.		"I have been expecting you. Give me the Pendants of Life and Death so I may rejoin them to serve their unholy purpose."
