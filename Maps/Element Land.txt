Christian's diary I		It's been several days since all the great rulers of the land were taken by some ill magic. After rallying the kingdoms elite force of angels we have tracked them down and sent out multiple parties of angels to try and find the source of the spell they are all under. One party has returned saying they have found a portal that leads straight to an evil wizard's secret base, however the portal will take a week to reach. The angels are sure this is the root of the dark magic and slaying the wizard will save the kingdom.
